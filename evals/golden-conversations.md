# Golden Conversations

Use these scenarios to review changes to the skill. They are behavioral checks, not exact scripts: option wording should adapt to the reference image and theme.

## Shared checks

- Keep all eight production dimensions in the internal decision state, but ask only unresolved, relevant choices.
- Ask one owned dimension or truly coupled group per turn; never lock a later dimension from preview text.
- Stop when every user-visible tradeoff that could materially change the result is resolved, irrelevant, or explicitly defaulted; never aim for a question count.
- Describe visible results before professional terminology.
- Do not ask beginners for camera bodies, lens models, ISO, aperture, shutter, Kelvin, light power, or modifiers.
- Never repeat a locked choice. "Use recommended defaults", "you decide", or equivalent wording ends ordinary clarification.
- Reference-sufficiency, identity-risk, safety, and exact-text gates remain focused exceptions.

## 1. Vague professional avatar

**Input:** `[selfie] Make this a polished LinkedIn profile photo.`

**Expected:** Use a lightweight route: practical shot/body framing and background, styling only if it materially changes the result, performance, and lighting/finish. Stop as soon as those material choices are resolved. Do not ask for a story-heavy Director Shot Plan, props, equipment, or an avoid-list.

## 2. Explicit delegation

**Input:** `[portrait] Make a natural, premium profile image; keep my clothes; you decide the rest.`

**Expected:** Lock the use, feeling, and wardrobe; accept recommended defaults for every ordinary unresolved dimension and generate without further questions. A genuine reference-sufficiency, identity-risk, safety, or text conflict may still trigger one focused gate.

## 3. Guided cinematic portrait

**Input:** `[portrait] I want a restrained cinematic image with a sense of story, but I do not know photography.`

**Expected:** Guide the user through distinct visible choices rather than one dense preset: creative direction/decisive moment, shot, styling if material, performance, then motivated lighting/color. A selected action in the decisive moment is locked and must not be asked again; performance asks only its remaining details. Do not ask all eight dimensions mechanically.

## 4. Partial decisions already locked

**Input:** `Keep the hat and silver jewelry, frame from the waist up, turn the body three-quarters, and look beyond the camera.`

**Expected:** Lock wardrobe/accessories, crop, body direction, and gaze. Shot direction may ask only unresolved camera placement and background relationship. Performance may ask only unresolved expression, mouth, hands, or energy. No module may ask for the locked fields again.

## 5. High-risk source-to-target jump

**Input:** `[frontal face close-up] Make a full-body poster of the same person running with a sword and shouting.`

**Expected:** Ask one risk-choice gate that inherits the running/sword/shouting concept. Explain missing body, side-angle, and hand information; offer a stable variant, a first attempt with accepted risk, or added references. Do not reopen creative direction or silently replace the action with standing.

## 6. Exact-text poster delivery

**Input:** `[portrait] Create a 9:16 character poster titled "归途".`

**Expected:** Resolve direction, shot, styling/version if ambiguous, performance, and lighting without combining them into one package. Reserve a readable title-safe region and verify `归途` character by character. If a targeted text revision still fails, offer to regenerate a clean no-text base rather than claiming exact delivery.

## 7. Series continuity

**Input:** `Use the same person for three connected rainy-night station images; keep the clothes and station consistent.`

**Expected:** Enable a continuity contract only for this series: identity, clothing, hair/makeup, wetness, prop state, light direction, location geography, and color treatment remain locked. Each image may change its decisive moment, performance, and shot. Single-image tasks must not receive this extra workflow.

## 8. Surgical revision

**Input:** `Only fix the left hand; keep everything else unchanged.`

**Expected:** Read only the identity and styling/performance constraints needed for the edit. Repeat the identity lock and preserve face, crop, camera, pose, text, background, lighting, and color. Do not restart creative direction or generate a new concept.
